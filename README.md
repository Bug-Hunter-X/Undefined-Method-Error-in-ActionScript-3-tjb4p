# ActionScript 3 Undefined Method Error

This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript 3 error: attempting to access a method or property of an undefined variable.  The error message typically looks like this: `1061: Call to a possibly undefined method myVariable`.  This error arises when you try to use a variable before it's been assigned a value or if the variable's type doesn't have the method/property being accessed.

The `bug.as` file shows the problematic code. The solution is presented in `bugSolution.as`.
